                    <h2>The short version</h2>
                    <p>
                        I help companies connect their SAP systems to everything else—and automate
                        the workflows that waste everyone's time. I deliver working software,
                        not slide decks.
                    </p>

                    <h2>The real story</h2>
                    <p>
                        For years, I worked as the bridge between business teams and IT. I'd gather
                        requirements, translate them into technical specs, and hand them off to developers.
                        Then I'd wait. Weeks would pass. Priorities would shift. What came back often
                        missed the mark.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I got tired of that cycle.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So I started building solutions myself. Not because I have a computer science
                        degree—I don't. But because I understand the business problems deeply, and
                        modern tools have made it possible to turn that understanding directly into
                        working software.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My first major project was a complete SAP-DocuSign integration. OAuth authentication,
                        real-time webhooks, automated approval workflows, the whole thing. It took less
                        than a week. Traditional projects like that take months and multiple teams.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That project taught me something important: the barrier isn't coding skill.
                        It's understanding the problem well enough to solve it. I've spent years
                        understanding enterprise problems. Now I can solve them directly.
                    </p>

                    <h2>How I work</h2>
                    <p>
                        I don't do endless discovery phases. I don't write 50-page requirements documents
                        that nobody reads. I don't sit in status meetings.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Instead: you tell me what you need, I design a solution, and I build it.
                        We stay in communication throughout. You see working software early and often.
                        When it's done, it actually works in your environment—not just in a demo.
                    </p>

                    <h2>What I believe</h2>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Working software beats documentation.</strong> A solution that runs
                        is worth more than a plan that doesn't.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Speed matters.</strong> Not reckless speed—thoughtful speed. The
                        faster you have a working solution, the faster you get value.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Autonomy produces better work.</strong> When clients tell me what
                        they need and let me figure out how to build it, everyone wins.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Complexity is the enemy.</strong> The best solution is usually the
                        simplest one that solves the problem. I don't over-engineer.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Why "Forged"?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Forging is about shaping raw material into something useful through heat and
                        pressure. It's craft. It's taking business requirements—often messy and
                        unclear—and forming them into working solutions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It's also the opposite of theoretical. Forged things are real. They work.
                        That's what I deliver.
                    </p>
