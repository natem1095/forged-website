                    <h2>Forged from the trenches</h2>
                    <p>
                        I spent years in CPG manufacturing, working hands-on with SAP. Not from a conference
                        room—I was in the warehouse, on the loading dock, in the quality lab with a hairnet
                        and frock, observing operations. I mapped processes and configured SAP to work for
                        the people actually using it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When standard configurations couldn't solve a problem, waiting for corporate to
                        build solutions meant watching teams struggle for months with half-baked workarounds.
                        So I started building solutions myself—understanding the business problem and
                        delivering the fix directly.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The real test came with our SAP-DocuSign integration—the kind of solution SAP sells
                        as a product. The company had hired consultants who'd been circling for months. I
                        designed and programmed the complete architecture from the ground up, single-handedly,
                        in 4 days: 40 ABAP components, 15+ database tables, 16 documentation files, 2 business
                        integrations, OAuth authentication, real-time webhooks, automatic PO release. The kind
                        of project that takes consulting firms 6-9 months and $400K-$600K.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That experience shaped everything about how Forged works. The person who understands
                        the problem builds the solution. No handoffs, no committees, no months of discovery
                        that go nowhere. Just results.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Why we move faster</h2>
                    <p>
                        Traditional consulting separates understanding from building. Business analysts
                        write requirements. Developers interpret them months later. Information gets lost.
                        Solutions miss the mark.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We work differently:

                        <h3>AI + Expertise: A Force Multiplier</h3>
                        <p>
                            Some see AI coding tools and think "cheap labor replacement." We see a force multiplier
                            that lets experienced engineers ship faster without cutting corners. AI is excellent at
                            generating code patterns and documentation. It's terrible at understanding your business
                            problem, designing architecture, and knowing which SAP patterns actually work in production.

                        <li>You need someone who can understand your business problem <em>and</em> build the solution</li>
                        <li>You want working software, not a proposal that leads to more proposals</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>How we work</h2>
                    <p>
                        We don't do endless discovery phases. We don't write 50-page requirements documents
                        that nobody reads. We don't cycle junior consultants through your project while
                        a senior partner checks in quarterly.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Instead: we go to where the work happens. We talk to the people using the systems—not
                        just management. We understand the actual workflow, the workarounds, what everyone
                        wishes the system could do. Then we build it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You see working software early and often. When it's done, it works in your
                        environment—not just in a demo.
                    </p>

                    <h2>What we believe</h2>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Speed comes from removing layers, not cutting corners.</strong>
                        Traditional consulting models add layers. Layers add complexity. We remove layers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Working software beats proposals.</strong>
                        Proposals can be impressive. Decks can be polished. But software either works in your environment or it doesn't.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Complexity is the enemy.</strong>
                        The best solution is usually the simplest one that solves the problem. We don't over-engineer, and we don't build for hypothetical futures.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Aligned incentives matter.</strong>
                        When consultants bill by the hour, they're rewarded for taking longer. When we quote fixed prices, we're rewarded for solving your problem efficiently. That's how it should work.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Why "Forged"?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Forging is about shaping raw material into something useful through heat and
                        pressure. It's craft. It's taking business requirements—often messy and
                        unclear—and forming them into working solutions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It's the opposite of theoretical. Forged things are real. They work.
                        That's what we deliver.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Security & Compliance</h2>

                <p>I spent 8 years implementing SAP for CPG companies. Not from a conference room - I was in the warehouse, on the loading dock, in the quality lab with a hairnet and frock, observing the operation. I mapped processes and configured SAP to actually work for the people using it.</p>
                <p>But there were times it wouldn't. And getting through corporate hurdles to build what was needed was a slow process - most of the time nothing came of it anyway. I watched our teams take months to deliver solutions that never really solved the pain-point.</p>
                <p>So I went rogue. I wasn't in a developer role, but I got the access and started building solutions myself. Turns out I could deliver nearly perfect, fully documented solutions in a fraction of the time - with better attention to detail and more features than anything the dev team produced.</p>
                <p>Then came the real test: our SAP to DocuSign integration. The company had spun in circles for months and hired consultants to make it happen. Guess what I did... I built the complete architecture myself - fully integrated to the standard SAP approval workflow so that as soon as a user clicked save, the approver had a DocuSign email. Once signed, PO released. End to end. Documented. Delivered... In 4 days.</p>
                <p>The inbox floods with "congratulations!" and "good jobs!" Then it gets to the development team for review. "There's a process" they said.</p>
                <p>That's when I broke. I couldn't stand the corporate barriers anymore.</p>
                <p>So begins Forged Technologies. AI has changed what it means to be a developer. Combine that with years of front-facing manufacturing experience and you have a hammer meeting steel.</p>
                <p>No more one hour meetings that go three. No more "SAP can't do that." And no more slide decks.</p>
                <p>If an out-of-the-box solution doesn't solve your problem, we build something that does - whether directly in SAP/Salesforce/Oracle or through a secure custom integration.</p>
                <p>Flat rate pricing upfront.</p>
                <p>If this sounds like what you need then send us a message.</p>
                <p>Hope we speak soon,</p>
